Music & Me: Sector 71 Guys

The Delhi trap scene has been a sonic adventure, a raw expression of life in the streets. My journey began with Vasudev's early work; his Ghaziabad Mixtape was packed with raw energy, while the Delhi Metro Series showcased a refreshing perspective. Unfortunately, Vasudev faded from the spotlight..

but Delhi Trap had another plans, and that's where the Sector 71 guys emerged, carrying the torch and redefining Delhi's trap sound.

As **Raftaar** aptly described the scene:

>Brodie kuch bhi kehdo fancy,
>Yahan na koi gang shi,
>Sab rapperon ki family,
>Yahan 90 percent panzis

>Brother spitting fancy,
>Thereâ€™s no gang shit here,
>All the rappers have families,
>and yeah, 90 percent are posers.

Sector 71 guys stood out for being REAL AF!
