Music always had a special place for me. Starting from early days when I was ashamed of listening to music in front of my parents for some reason? To the point where it started making sense. I always liked music with meaning even as a child. It always gave me an identity.

<br>

Growing up I used to listen to a lot of **Green Day** because it made me feel like I have an identity. Growing up in a tier 2 city of India. No one was listening to Green day specially from the high school I was a part of. emotions and rebellious spirit of adolescence. It helped me find a voice that I'm not alone going through frustration, alienation, identity, and defiance against societal norms because I didn't like the culture I was a part of. The album Dookie and the song basket case lived rent free for a very long time. The American Idiot album with layers of meaning just had a different impact on me while growing up.

<br>

Next part of my life was covered by **Nirvana**; the grunge "unpolished" sound made me feel like I don't give a fuck about what others gonna think. I'm gonna do and say what I believe in because my beliefs aren't abnormal which was confirmed by Green Day. If there is one man to this day that I deeply admire and consider him a living image of being a true role model as an artist despite his issues would be Kurt Cobain! He was unfiltered and honest, both in his art and in how he lived. He conveyed even as a public figure it's okay to feel insecure. He was one person, had no "social media celebrity life" like him or not he is who he is. 

<br>

I was very insecure on how I looked while growing up. Making peace with myself and loving who I am was taught by these two bands. 

<br>

I had a run where I listened to different spectrum of metal music, LP and Eminem. But the next big story comes with a taste change in music taste. 

<br>

**Red Hot Chilli Peppers**. Under the bridge. I called this song as my national anthem in 2017/18. I was out of my hometown, fighting loneliness, alienation, and finding solace in his connection to the city which had beautiful buildings during a difficult time. I started to make myself feel home whenever I see a building that I like. That's true even today in my current city. I was heavily inspired by John Frusciante art on his guitar. That man is straight up gifted. I studied him perfected the song and I can play it perfectly. 

<br>

Then comes the biggest shift in my music taste. So far all these years I just chose to listen to music from the west until 2020/21 when I started to fall in love with a new genre. I came across an artist names Kr$na and oh man I felt like someone is basically speaking to me in my own language about my hardships and life and how there's light in the end of the tunnel. My national anthem changed. From songs like Dream and Kaha tak by Krsna made me feel like he is narrating my life story and it's in the same order as the verses flow by. His music style with complexity and endendres made me just fall in love with this genre called Desi Hip Hop. 

<br>

I discovered many artists early on before they blew up and I am glad I am part of that culture. A lot of songs, EPs and albums have impacted my life. I'd love to write more about that probably every week.

<br>

Right now I don't listen to as much lyrical hip-hop. I am into trap. Yes, I speak Trapnese. I feel like I've started to slowly crawl out of my struggling phase, I'm far from home and still here but I've started to like laid back flex trappy song now. I am enjoying my Broke Flex era. 

<br>

Recently, I discovered the artist by the name of Jaiyash. And I love his art. It's very western and he is making music on the side, for his bread and butter he streams and does comedy but he's a far better musician. I have immense respect for people who "do it on the side" like Joji who made it big in the music. Another artist that just stole the spot for the best song of the year was AFKAP by his song Waapsi. Bro is from India, living far from home bred and butter but makes music in his free time. His EP Parat is just a masterpiece. Again feels like someone spoke my heart out. 

<br>

I am not a shy person, I speak my heart out. But I probably feel alone or have always felt alone. Hearing someone talk about my issues and struggles make me feel comfortable and home.
