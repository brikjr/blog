- Music always had a special place for me. Starting from early days when I was ashamed of listening to music in front of my parents for some reason? To the point where it started making sense. I always liked music with meaning even as a child. It always gave me an identity.


- Growing up I used to listen to a lot of Green Day because it made me feel like I have an identity. Growing up in a tier 2 city of India. No one was listening to Green day specially from the high school I was a part of. emotions and rebellious spirit of adolescence. It helped me find a voice that I'm not alone going through frustration, alienation, identity, and defiance against societal norms because I didn't like the culture I was a part of. The album Dookie and the song basket case lived rent free for a very long time. The American Idiot album with layers of meaning just had a different impact on me while growing up.
